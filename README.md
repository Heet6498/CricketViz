### Introduction
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. Here in this End-to-End Data visualization Project I scraped data from the ESPNCricinfo website. This site contains historical cricket data. With the help of various tools I programmed  this End-to-End Data visualization Project.
